# homebridge-iRobot-v2

A Homebridge plugin to integrate iRobot Roombas into HomeKit.

This plugin is based on <a href="https://github.com/bloomkd46/homebridge-iRobot">homebridge-IRobot</a>, but since this plugin has not gotten
any updates for a long time, I decided to create a new plugin based on the old one. This plugin is not compatible with the old one, so you have 
to remove the old plugin and install this one. The general idea for this new plugin is to make fix reported bugs and keep it up to date where necessary.

Once the latest iOS 18 update is released, I will update the plugin to support the new features (if possible).
